This repository contains a lecture I gave for Haifa::C++ Group in Israel - https://www.meetup.com/Haifa-CPP/

The ODT file is what I presented there: https://www.meetup.com/haifa-cpp/events/253386484/

The C++/Qt5 code in this repository is a simple socket/server app written in Qt5 which demostrates how easy Qt5 is to program with, and shows that Qt is not only about GUI.
